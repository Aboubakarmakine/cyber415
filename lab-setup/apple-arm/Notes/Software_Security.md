# Software Security Labs

## Buffer Overflow Labs

With our new Shellcode for aarch64 architecture, we can 
now revise the buffer overflow lab. We have decided not 
to do the L1 and L2 tasks, as they are based on the 32-bit
code. Instead, we will focus on L3 and L4 tasks, while adding 
one similar to L2, but using 64-bit code. 

We will only port the server version of the lab, as we
plan to gradually phase out the Set-UID version, so we 
can focus on one version (too time-consuming to maintain
two similar labs). Both labs can achieve the same educational 
objectives. 


## Return-to-libc Lab

Since this lab is based on the 32-bit x86 code, we will 
probably not port this lab to the ARM. We would like to develop
a new return-to-libc lab using the AMD64 code. When we 
start this project, we will also try the ARM64. Help is needed
to get this project started. 


## Format String Lab

Still under construction.
