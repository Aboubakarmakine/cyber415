\section{Task 5: Level-4 Attack} 

The server in this task is similar to that in Level 3, 
except that the buffer size is much smaller. From the 
following printout, you can see the distance between 
the frame pointer and the buffer's address is only about 32 bytes (the 
actual distance in the lab may be different).
In Level 3, the distance is much larger. Your goal is the same: 
get the root shell on this server. The server still takes in
517 byte of input data from the user.
